Welcome to Kana Coach

You’ll see kana (no kanji). Type the romaji and press Enter. Press Enter again to move on.
	•	Spaces don’t matter (watashi wa = watashiwa).
	•	Almost appears for common “close” spellings (e.g. cya for cha, or ha when は is the particle wa).
	•	wo / o are both accepted when を is used as the object particle (standard is usually o).
	•	Trouble kana tracks characters you miss most — even when they appear inside different words/sentences.
	•	Your progress is saved locally on this device/browser.
